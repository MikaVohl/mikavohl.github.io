I love building products, solving challenging problems, and learning new things. My interest and experience lies mostly in the domains of Machine Learning, Computer Science, and Physics.

I'm currently:
- Researching machine learning imputation techniques in medical data with McGill AI Society
- A fullstack developer for McHacks, McGill's largest hackathon
- Part of the weekly ML reading group at McGill
